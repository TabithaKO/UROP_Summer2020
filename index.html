                <p>My name is Tabitha Oanda. I'm a junior (3rd year) at Boston University majoring in Computer Science.
                    This summer I had the opportunity to do research with my mentor, Prof. Mike Economo, through the
                    Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). I'm excited to tell you how I used different
                    deep learing
                    applications in my
                    summer research project titled, <strong>'Animal Feature Tracking and Pose Prediction'.</strong></p>

                    <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Understanding how the brain works requires the study of natural behavior. In rodents, complex
                    behaviors can be tracked using videography. Tracking behaviors in video data manually is time
                    consuming and subject to researcher bias. In this project, we explored the feasibility of tracking
                    animal behavior in an automated, unbiased manner with computer vision. We collected video of a
                    freely moving rat in an open arena and then used markerless pose prediction software, DeepLabCut
                    (DLC), to automatically track the features of a freely behaving rat. We explored other pose
                    prediction software packages such as Deep Pose Kit and Animal Parts Tracker, but had best results
                    with DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results obtained from the pose prediction algorithm were then used in a forecasting model that
                    predicted the future trajectory of the rat for up to 2 seconds. These predicted trajectories can be
                    compared with the machine generated trajectories to validate normal movement patterns or identify
                    movement anomalies. One of the other applications of the pose prediction results is behavior
                    classification using unsupervised deep learning methods. Utilizing data from DLC for unsupervised
                    learning can be accomplished using software tools like MoSeq for behavior
                    classification.

                        anyway.</strong></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">How it began ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">In February 2020, I walked up to my professor at a NSBE networking event
                        and said:</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef"> "Hi. My name is Tabitha. I'm a sophomore in Computer Science. I taught
                        myself machine learning and I'm looking for an opportunity to use this knowledge on some
                        real-world applications. Do you have any openings at your lab? </span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">He said yes and later on gave me more context on the work he and his team
                        do at the lab.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">I got this research opportunity because I was willing to try, not because
                        I had an impressive resume. I was willing to work with my mentor and learn as much as I possible
                        could.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">My professor is in Biomedical Engineering and I'm in Computer Science. At
                        BU those 2 are not even in the same college. We discuss Neuroscience related research papers on
                        a weekly basis. I understand about 30% of the content, but that's ok because I get to ask
                        questions whenever stuff is unclear. What's imprtant is that I never ask the same question
                        twice.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">I was at the lab for 10 weeks over the summer
                        and learnt way more than i bargained for. The main takeaways are:</span></p>
                <ul><span class="curiositydef">
                        <li>Keep asking questions. (even the 'dumb' ones).</li>
                        <li>Keep showing up. (you never know who you'll encounter).</li>
                        <li>Keep reaching out to people you want to work with. The right person will respond.</li>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone (I disliked biology in high school, who'd
                            have
                            thought I'd work with a biomedical engineering professor)</li>
                        <li>Remember: You're already a <strong>winner</strong> for trying!</li>

                <p><strong>Lesson: It's the tasks that you assign yourself
                        that matter the most.</strong></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">My mentor and I would often begin the week by discussing a few
                        objectives and the methods required to achieve those objectives. There are a few times when I
                        was
                        going to be the first person at the lab to implement certain software, so I didn't have a
                        reference
                        to consult or a clear vision of the end product.</span></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">Sometimes this was scary. What if I messed up? What if I ruined the
                        data?</span></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">The point is that there were a few tasks my mentor wanted me to complete
                        that were known to the both of us. However, there were even more tasks that I needed to do and
                        more
                        information that I needed to obtain in order to do the specified tasks efficiently -- these
                        tasks were
                        only known to me.</span></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">What did I do?</span></p>
                <ul><span class="diligencedef">
                        <li>I consulted Google. It was important for me to do my due diligence before reporting
                            bugs/blockers.</li>
                        <li>I read research papers about the technology.</li>
                        <li>I tried a few simple tutorials.(There's a lot you can learn on YouTube and the TensorFlow
                            docs)
                        </li>
                        <li>I read Medium articles that simplified the information.</li>
                        <li>I documented all the unsuccessful methods I had tried in order to track my progress.</li>
                    </span></ul>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">My mentor didn't need to know all the things that I did behind the scenes,
                        but my project benefitted from me putting in the extra work.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Lesson: Prototypes fail and the hypothesis gets
                        vague, but you've got to keep moving.</strong></p>

                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">One of the new realizations I got while working at the lab is that I
                        often get to be my own student, teacher, and grader. This was unlike any of my college
                        classes. When you start a project, you come up with the hypothesis and you develop the route to
                        the solution. Finally, you know when you're right because your method validates your
                        hypothesis.</span>
                </p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">We began by asking the question: 'Can we use deep learning to annotate
                        animal behavior?' In order to answer this question I needed to understand how CNNs worked. It
                        was a rude shock when I realized
                        that my proposed route failed me a couple of times, and that my implementations of some methods
                        were highly
                        inefficient. It was in those moments that my mentor stepped in and suggested an alternative
                        route to take.</span></p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef"> We unexpectedly ended up answering the question: 'Can we forecast the
                        future position of an animal using deep learning?' For this task I learned how to implement RNNs
                        for
                        forecasting.</span></p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">The takeaways:</span></p>
                <ul><span class="flexibilitydef">
                        <li>Be flexible with your methods</li>
                        <li>It's ok to ask for help (In fact it's wise)</li>
                        <li>Learn to communicate efficiently</li>

                        <li>It's ok to get things wrong sometimes</li>
                        <li>Again, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone</li>
