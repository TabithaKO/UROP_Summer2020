                <p>My name is Tabitha Oanda. I'm a junior (3rd year) at Boston University. I've been learning Machine
                    Learning for a couple of months now. I'm excited to show you how I used different applications in my
                    summer reseach project, <strong>'Animal Feature Tracking and Pose Prediction'.</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Understanding how the brain works requires the study of natural behavior. In rodents, complex
                    behaviors can be tracked using videography. Tracking behaviors in video data manually is time
                    consuming and subject to researcher bias. In this project, we explored the feasibility of tracking
                    animal behavior in an automated, unbiased manner with computer vision. We collected video of a
                    freely moving rat in an open arena and then used markerless pose prediction software, DeepLabCut
                    (DLC), to automatically track the features of a freely behaving rat. We explored other pose
                    prediction software packages such as Deep Pose Kit and Animal Parts Tracker, but had best results
                    with DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results obtained from the pose prediction algorithm were then used in a forecasting model that
                    predicted the future trajectory of the rat for up to 2 seconds. These predicted trajectories can be
                    compared with the machine generated trajectories to validate normal movement patterns or identify
                    movement anomalies. One of the other applications of the pose prediction results is behavior
                    classification using unsupervised deep learning methods. Utilizing data from DLC for unsupervised
                    learning can be accomplished using software tools like MoSeq for behavior
                    classification.

                <p><span class="curiositydef"><strong>Lesson: </strong>Uncertainty is part of the job but try
                        anyway.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">In research, 'Why...' and 'How...' questions quickly become the
                        norm.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">How it began ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">In February 2020, I walked up to my professor at a NSBE networking event
                        and said:</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef"> "Hi. My name is Tabitha. I'm a sophomore in Computer Science. I taught
                        myself machine learning and I'm looking for an opportunity to use this knowledge on some
                        real-world applications.Do you have any openings at your lab? </span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">I got this research opportunity because I was willing to try, not because
                        I had an impressive resume. I was willing to work with my mentor and learn as much as I possible
                        could.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef">My professor is in Biomedical Engineering and I'm in Computer Science. At
                        BU those 2 are not even in the same college. We discuss Neuroscience related research papers on
                        a weekly basis. I understand about 30% of the content, but that's ok because I get to ask
                        questions whenever stuff is unclear. What's imprtant is that I never ask the same question
                        twice.</span></p>
                <p><span class="curiositydef"></span> The rest is history. I was at the lab for 10 weeks over the summer
                    and learnt way more than i bargained for. The main takeaways are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep asking questions (even the 'dumb' ones).</li>
                    <li>Keep showing up (you never know who you'll encounter).</li>
                    <li>Keep reaching out to people you want to work with. The right person will respond.</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone (I disliked biology in high school, look at me
                        now)</li>
                    <li>Remeber: You're already a <strong>winner</strong> for tyring!</li>

                <p><span class="diligencedef"></span><strong>Lesson: </strong>It's the tasks that you assign yourself
                    that matter the most.</p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef"></span>My mentor and I would often begin the week by discussing a few
                    objectives and the methods required to achieve those objectives. There are a few times when I was
                    going to be the first person at the lab to implement certain software, so I didn't have a reference
                    to consult or a clear vision of the end product.</p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">Sometimes this was scary. What is I messed up? What is I ruuined the
                        data?</span></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">The point is that there were a few tasks my mentor wanted me to complete
                        that were known to the both of us. There were even more tasks that I needed to do and more
                        information that I needed to obtain in order to do the tasks efficiently -- these tasks were
                        only known to me.</span></p>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">What did I do?</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I consulted Google. It was important for me to do my due diligence before reporting
                        bugs/blockers.</li>
                    <li>I read research papers about the technology.</li>
                    <li>I tried a few simple tutorials.(There's a lot you can learn on YouTube and the TensorFlow docs
                    </li>
                    <li>I read medium articles that simplified the information.</li>
                    <li>I documented all the unsuccessful methods I had tried in order to track my progress.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="diligencedef">My mentor didn't need to know all the things that I did behind the scenes,
                        but my project benefitted from me putting in the extra work.</span></p>

                <p><span class="flexibilitydef"><strong>Lesson: </strong>Prototypes fail and the hypothesis gets
                        vague, but you've
                        got to keep moving.</span></p>

                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">One of the new realizations I got while working at the lab is that I
                        often get to be my own student, teacher, and grader. This was unlike a lot of my college
                        classes. When you start a project, you come up with the hypothesis and you develop the route to
                        the solution. Finally, you know when you're right because it validates your hypothesis.</span>
                </p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">We began by asking the question: 'Can we ude deep learning to annotate
                        animal behavior?' I needed to understand how CNNs worked. It was a rude shock when i realized
                        that my route failed me a couple of times and that my implementation of some methods were highly
                        inefficient. It was in those moments that my mentor stepped in and suggested an alternative
                        route to take.</span></p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef"> We unexpectedly ended up answering the question: 'Can we forecast the
                        future position of an animal using deep learning?' I ended up learning how to implement RNNs for
                        forecasting.</span></p>
                <p><span class="flexibilitydef">The takeaways:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be flexible with your methods</li>
                    <li>It's ok to ask for help (In fact it's wise)</li>
                    <li>Learn to communicate efficiently</li>
                    <li>Be open to criticism</li>
                    <li>It's ok to get things wrong sometimes</li>
                    <li>Again, don't be afrais to step out of your comfort zone</li>
